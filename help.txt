The goal is to create a stack of cards from low to high in each of the four foundation piles.
Each pile can contain only one suit beginning with Aces and ending with Kings.
In tableau you must place cards in descending order while alternating suit colors.
You can also move sequential runs of cards between columns.
If there is an empty column in tableau you can put King there or any sequential stack with King at its head.
If you get stuck try drawing cards from deck into the waste.
